# Staff

This list is not exhaustive and is in no particular order.

### Xe

The founder of ShadowNET, Xe has guided the creation of elemental-ircd and 
worked hard to make Cod and Atheme work symbiotically with it. Their favorite 
color is blue and you can find them on github [here](http://github.com/lyska). 
Might sometimes be online as `shadowh511`, `lyska` or `Xena`.

### Caerdwyn

The founder of DashNet, an IRC network that merged into ShadowNET, a capable 
Linux system administrator who is still learning (as we all are), but has 
proven himself to be ready for the task. Bug him if there's something wrong 
with the website, the server is down, etc.

### Quora

One of the main stakeholders in Elemental-IRCd and Cod.

### Zazie

Some person Xe initially found slaving at the QA mines of Microsoft Xbox 
hardware testing. Rescued from this former home of moronic users (and 
PurpleSurge), they now thrive here as a core part of the staff. Experienced in 
Anope, Atheme, and some other third thing.

### Lore

See one of the DashNet ZNC accounts connected somewhere, or does our Minecraft 
server intrigue you? Contact him if you want in.
