## Administrators

### Xe

The founder of ShadowNET, Xe has guided the creation of elemental-ircd and 
worked hard to make Cod and Atheme work symbiotically with it. Their favorite 
color is blue and you can find them on github [here](http://github.com/lyska). 
Might sometimes be online as `shadowh511`, `lyska` or `Xena`.

### Caerdwyn

The founder of DashNet, an IRC network that merged into ShadowNET, a capable 
Linux system administrator who is still learning (as we all are), but has 
proven himself to be ready for the task. Bug him if thereâ€™s something wrong 
with the website, the server is down, etc.

## Operators

### Lore

See one of the DashNet ZNC accounts connected somewhere, or does our Minecraft 
server intrigue you? Contact him if you want in.

### Sephira

She's shy but friendly. Sephira is one of the newer additions to the family, 
she is currently learning about operating and proceeding very well in this.
