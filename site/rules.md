# Rules

These rules may change at any time with or without warning and it is your job 
to have read them.

## ShadowNET User Rules

Aka: the 5 "don'ts"

 - Don't be a dick
 - Don't try to find holes in the rules
 - Don't evade bans/quiets
 - Don't creep on people
 - Don't flood channels or private messages unless otherwise allowed to

Depending on the severity of the infraction, measures may be taken at a network 
level.

## ShadowNET Administrative Policy

ShadowNET operators and administrators will not get involved in channel matters 
unless they have flags in that channel. ShadowNET staff will not care about 
what goes on in channels unless they need to or are talking in them. ShadowNET 
staff is not any different from normal users except for a flag and a lot of 
extra work.

K-lines are reserved only for those who truly earn them.

 - If /ignore solves the problem rather than a kick, /ignore
 - Kick if a ban is unneeded
 - Ban if a /kill is unwarranted for
 - Kill rather than kline if that solves the problem
 - Kline when a server ban is really needed.

Please do not ask to be ShadowNET staff. If the current staff body believes in 
good faith that a user is capable of becoming ShadowNET staff, they will be 
picked for the role.

ShadowNET staff will never force you to join channels or forcibly change your 
user modes as the IRC daemon we use does not allow that to be done.

## Session Limits

If you are willing to offer a bouncer or have other needs to raise your session 
limit, please ask an operator in `#help`. We will ask that you have identd 
running and that idents are non-user changeable, as well as having a channel on 
ShadowNET registered in case there is abuse. Your connections from that IP will 
also be automatically cloaked by Zuul.

`14:34 -!- ShadowNET-B56FA3144E0B.yolo-swag.com is now your hidden host (set by Zuul)`

`14:34 -Zuul(zuul@services.yolo-swag.com)- Your vhost has been uniquely randomized as a part of a policy set by your BNC host and network staff. If your desired vhost doesn't show up, please re-activate it using /msg HostServ ON`
